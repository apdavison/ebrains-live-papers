          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://live-paper-builder.netlify.app/"
              >EBRAINS Live Papers</a
            >
            are intended to be structured and interactive supplementary
            documents to complement journal publications, that allow users to
            readily access, explore and utilize the various kinds of data
            underlying scientific studies. Interactivity is a prominent feature
            with several integrated tools and services that will allow users to
            download, visualise or simulate data, models and results presented
            in the corresponding publications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Live Papers bring together various neuroscience related resources
            thereby providing a more complete picture of the original modelers'
            workspace. By virtue of being developed within the EBRAINS
            infrastructure setup, Live Papers are able to effectively leverage
            the Knowledge Graph (KG) for storing all information. The KG, being
            a graph based database, interlinks all data units thereby readily
            offering a high degree of data provenance.

              <p>The Model Catalog lets you filter the list of models by:</p>

                <li>
                  what is being modelled (species, brain region, cell type)

                <li>
                  the scope of the model (subcellular, single cell, network,
                  whole brain)
                </li>
                <li>
                  the abstraction level of the model (cognitive, neural field,
                  biophysical, spiking point neuron, systems biology)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also search by author or model name.</p>

              <p>
                The catalog contains a detailed description of each model, a
                download link for each version of the model, and information
                about the validation of each model (i.e. comparing simulation
                results to experimental data).
              </p>
              <p>
                Some models have links to other EBRAINS applications where the
                models can be simulated and/or or explored in more detail.

              <p>
                If you are developing your own model and wish to share it
                through the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph, adding it to the Model
                Catalog is the first step.
              </p>
              <p>
                You don't need to wait until the model is published in a journal
                article, entries can be marked as private and shared only with
                your chosen collaborators.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you're ready to share publicly, our team of professional
                data and model curators will check the model is ready to be
                shared (code archived, terms of reuse specified, ...) then
                release it to the public

              <p>
                Using the Model Catalog Python client, you can access models
                from within a Jupyter notebook (e.g. in the EBRAINS Jupyter
                Lab), giving you access to a still wider range of tools and
                services.

              <p>
                As mentioned above, one of the main aims of the EBRAINS Model
                Catalog is to show how models compare to experiments.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use the SciUnit framework to formalize the comparison of
                models and experiments as "validation tests", and show both
                information about these tests and the results of the tests in
                the Model Catalog.
              </p>
              <p>
                Running the same set of validation tests with different, but
                related models, is a powerful tool for comparing models and
                deciding which is best for your purpose.

              How is the EBRAINS Model Catalog different to other model
              databases?
            </h3>
            <p>
              A number of other model databases are available in neuroscience,
              including ModelDB, BioModels, and Open Source Brain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The EBRAINS Model Catalog is complementary to these other
              databases, providing validation results and making it possible to
              use models with other EBRAINS tools and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where a model is also available in one of these other databases,

              The Model Catalog can be used for models at all stages of
