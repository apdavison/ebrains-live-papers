Interactivity is a prominent feature with several integrated tools and services that will allow users to download, visualise or simulate data, models and results presented in the corresponding publications.\n\nThe web app allows anyone to view and interact with published live papers. It also includes an authoring tool, the live paper builder, which requires an EBRAINS account.",
